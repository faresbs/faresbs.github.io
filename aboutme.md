Wow, I cannot think of anything!

### My story

I was born and raised in the vibrant country of **Tunisia**, where I spent nearly 23 years of my life. If you're unsure where that is, you might need to brush up on your geography! Nestled in North Africa, Tunisia is a treasure trove of diverse landscapes and rich cultural influences. Imagine wandering through ancient streets of Greece and Italy, basking in the sophistication of French culture, lounging on Maldivian turquoise beaches, exploring the vast, tranquil Sahara deserts, and hiking through lush forests and majestic mountainsâ€”all within one country. I promise, I wasn't paid by the Ministry of tourism to say all of this, but I highly recommend a visit.

Driven by a thirst for new experiences and knowledge, I decided to pursue my studies abroad. Out of all the places in the world, I chose our dear Great North **Canada**, particularly in **Montreal**. To be honest, I love Canada!, Maybe not as much during winter. Living abroad pushed me out of my comfort zone and taught me invaluable lessons about embracing **diversity** and learning from those who are different from me, which paradoxically helped me find my way and discover my true self.

I pursued a master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Quebec in Montreal. It was there that I discovered my passion for **Artificial Intelligence**. I was captivated by its potential and decided to make it my career path. Since then, I have been dedicated to leveraging AI to solve real-world problems. There is no doubt that AI will drive the next economic **revolution**, and I am thrilled to be a part of this transformative journey.
